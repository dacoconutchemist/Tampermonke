#  GummerCraftNameReplacer
This is a thing in Ukrainian that replaces names on the LiveAtlas minecraft minimap (works only with the one found on https://map.gummercraft.fun). It is easily modifiable to work with other LiveAtlas minimaps.
# PrntScNextImage
A thing that lets you look through leaked screenshots at prnt.sc. They have switched to a new url system, but for the sake of backwards compatibility, some of the screenshots are still hosted there. Almost all of them were removed, so good luck with finding more! ALL CRYPTO WALLET ACCOUNT DATA THERE IS HONEY POT CRYPTO SCAMS
# YTUtils
This lets you:
* Download MP3 / MP4 from a video on YouTube by clicking a link near the title. Because such websites get blocked constantly, check for updates regularly in case that happens!
* Copy a link to a playlist (because for some reason sharing a playlist is available only on mobile)
* Hide the time left on a video (from your mom that wants to see how much later you will be going to bed) by pressing [H] (works only on keyboard layouts with English letters / Cyrillic letters)
# MapartCraftUtils
Adds cool features to MapartCraft, such as:
* Conversion of block amounts to and from stacks and shulkerboxes
* A rotate button to test animated maparts
* Changes the blocky font to actually be the font from Minecraft (works on cyrillic letters and the English alphabet)
# DacoMap
All nuances are the same as GummerCraftNameReplacer. This thing allows you to draw things over a Minecraft map, by tracking a marker with known coordinates and thus converting Minecraft coordinates to on-screen ones. Polygon boolean operations are also included. **This is a WIP thing.**
